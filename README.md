# Welcome to Central Oklahoma Coders!

We are glad you found our repo, and that you have decided to join us! <br/>
We are a Codecademy Community Chapter based out of Central Oklahoma, and we welcome anyone that is interested to join us. <br/>
## What are we about?
Well to keep it short and sweet I began this chapter to meet like minded individuals with a desire to learn. <br/>
# What do we do?
We are a community of individuals that love software development, though currently small we aim to grow as a community together. <br/>
Though I don't have everything laid in stone, I would like to work as a team to build projects and learn together. <br/>
Some of the things I would like to do include, but are not limited to:
- Monthly in person meetups
- BiWeekly or even more Virtual Meetups
- Working sessions that individuals can schedule amongst themselves.
# Where do I get started?
- Make sure that you have signed up on https://community.codecademy.com/central-oklahoma/. This is how Codecademy tracks Chapters. <br/>
- We will use this repo to host all of our projects. <br/>
