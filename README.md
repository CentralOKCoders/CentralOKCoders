# Welcome to Central Oklahoma Coders!

I am glad you found our space, and that you have decided to join us! <br/>
We are a Codecademy Community Chapter based out of Central Oklahoma, and we welcome anyone that is interested to join us. <br/>
## What are we about?
Well to keep it short and sweet I began this chapter to meet like minded individuals with a desire to learn. <br/>
## Who am I?
Let me introduce myself, my name is Nathanial and I am the Chapter Leader. Let me tell you a few things about myself.
- I am a DevOps Engineer and got my start as one in 2020.
- My background in computers started in helpdesk, where I moved over to a SOC team, and then I ended up where I am today.
- I have been dabbling in different programming languages for a little over 6 years but my preferrences are:
  - C#
  - Python
# What do we do?
We are a community of individuals that love software development, though currently small we aim to grow as a community together. <br/>
Though I don't have everything laid in stone, I would like to work as a team to build projects and learn together. <br/>
Some of the things I would like to do include, but are not limited to:
- Monthly in person meetups
- BiWeekly or even more Virtual Meetups
- Working sessions that individuals can schedule amongst themselves.
# Where do I get started?
